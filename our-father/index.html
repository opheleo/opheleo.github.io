He gives them a template that begins quite astonishingly. It starts with the phrase "Our Father!"</p><p>The so-called 'gods' of this world, whether human or demonic, expect the people who beseech them to come cowering before them, trembling and quaking with fear. Whether it be a minor government official, or a religious charlatan who demands monetary or ritual sacrifices, those drunk on merely limited, temporary, and worldly power are prone to demand fear as recompense for their audience to petitions, whether or not they have the power or the ability to grant these petitions.</p><p>But Jesus, the Son of the eternal, everlasting God, the every epitome of power in this Universe, through the template he gave for prayer teaches all who would follow Him a very important point. His Father, and by implication He Himself, desires a relationship of love with those who beseech Him.&nbsp;</p><p>This paradigm was a stark contrast to the God of the Jews the disciples had known so far, corrupted as their idea of God was by the faulty religious teachings of the day. And so through this iconoclastic beginning to prayer, Jesus showed them that they had nothing to fear from a loving Father God.&nbsp;</p><p>And He could teach them thus, because He knew that He had come into the world to die, and that by His sacrifice of His own pure life, the wrath of God towards sinful humanity would be completely extinguished.</p><p>And so today, through His sacrifice, and through His name, we can approach the all-powerful God with childlike trust, leaping into His lap with the greeting, "Father...!"</p><p></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 17, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Four-father%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Four-father%2F&amp;via=Worm&amp;text=Our%20Father" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Four-father%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F25%2Ffathers-hand.jpg&amp;description=Our%20Father" class="js-share icon brands fa-pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Pinterest</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Four-father%2F&amp;title=Our%20Father" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Our%20Father https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Four-father%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><strong>Tagged in:</strong></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/gleanings/">Biblical</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/gospel/">Gospel</a></li></ul></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://worm.gq/" target="_self">Home</a></li><li class="has-submenu"><a href="https://worm.gq/writings/" target="_self" aria-haspopup="true" class="opener">Writings</a><ul class="submenu level-2" aria-hidden="true"><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/opinion/" target="_self">Opinion</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/gospel/" target="_self">Gospel</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/gleanings/" target="_self">Biblical</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/short-story/" target="_self">Short Story</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/poetry/" target="_self">Poetry</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/about/" target="_self">About</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/subscribe-2/" target="_self">Subscribe</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/contact/" target="_self">Contact</a></li></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Editor Pick's</h2></header><div class="mini-posts"><article><a href="https://worm.gq/a-fractured-arm-and-jai-shri-ram/" class="image fit"><img src="https://worm.gq/media/posts/23/Crutches.jpg" srcset="https://worm.gq/media/posts/23/responsive/Crutches-xs.jpg 300w, https://worm.gq/media/posts/23/responsive/Crutches-sm.jpg 480w, https://worm.gq/media/posts/23/responsive/Crutches-md.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 33vw" loading="lazy" height="960" width="640" alt=""></a><h3><a href="https://worm.gq/a-fractured-arm-and-jai-shri-ram/">A fractured arm and &quot;Jai Shri Ram&quot;</a></h3><p>On January 3, a few Christians in Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India were shocked out of their wits.
