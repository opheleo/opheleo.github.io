I’ll get some for you,” and he being a little bit stronger than Alex leaped higher, but it still wasn’t high enough.<br><br>Alex watched bemused as Marvey kept trying, his leaps getting more and more impotent as he tired. After some time, he slowly walked away. Marvey soon worn out, sat panting beneath the bunch of temptations, the wheels of his mind still grinding and churning.<br><br>In a while he leapt up as though struck by lightning and ran towards the quarry. An amused crow on a tree nearby soon saw him huffing back to the dangling promise of deliciousness, struggling to roll a large roundish boulder in front of him. A few hours later, Marvey was back again with another rock. At the end of the day, Marvey had built a big heap of large rocks beneath the bunch of grapes. He climbed it quivering with expectation, lips dripping and ready to relish the sweet succulence of the glistening grapes. He stretched out his paw, his eyes gleaming and tenderly plucked a single grape from the bunch. He rolled it around in his mouth and bit into it’s cold softness.<br><br>The crow on the tree saw him climbing down muttering and cursing, “Bah! The grapes are bitter!”<br><br>At nightfall, Alex was stretched out lazily beside the watering hole as the weary Marvey dragged himself to the pool to slake his burning thirst. “Didn’t I tell you the grapes must be bitter?”, he asked the glum Marvey who lapped up the water eagerly and flopped down beside him dejected.<br><br>“But...how did you know?’, Marvey cried out exasperated at Alex’s knowing smile, ‘I thought you said the grapes were bitter only because you yourself were bitter that you couldn’t reach the grapes.”<br><br>“Couldn’t I have figured out some way to get them, don’t you know me better than that, Marvey?’ Alex asked and continued, ‘But there as I was struggling to leap up to the height of the bunch and wearing myself out, I remembered what the teacher taught. Don’t you remember what He said? ‘The grapes that grow so high in this part of the country, appear sweet, but are always bitter.’<br><br>"You're right, I was bitter when I walked away. But that was only because I did not trust the Master's words early enough. I realized I had wasted too much effort on something that grew so high only to entice but not to delight.”<br></p><figure class="blockquote"><blockquote>Don't wear yourself out to get rich; because you know better, stop!</blockquote><figcaption>The Book of Proverbs 23:4 (CSB)</figcaption></figure></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on December 24, 2020</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Fbitter-grapes%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Fbitter-grapes%2F&amp;title=Bitter%20Grapes" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Bitter%20Grapes https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Fbitter-grapes%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><strong>Tagged in:</strong></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/short-story/">Short Story</a></li></ul></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://worm.gq/" target="_self">Home</a></li><li class="has-submenu"><a href="https://worm.gq/writings/" target="_self" aria-haspopup="true" class="opener">Writings</a><ul class="submenu level-2" aria-hidden="true"><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/opinion/" target="_self">Opinion</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/gospel/" target="_self">Gospel</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/gleanings/" target="_self">Biblical</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/short-story/" target="_self">Short Story</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/poetry/" target="_self">Poetry</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/about/" target="_self">About</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/subscribe-2/" target="_self">Subscribe</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/contact/" target="_self">Contact</a></li></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Editor Pick's</h2></header><div class="mini-posts"></div><ul class="actions"><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/writings/" class="button">More</a></li></ul></section><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>Use the form on the contact page to send Worm your comments, criticisms, or candy.
