Yet even though all of us are self-evidently endowed with the right to pursue happiness, we ought really to ask ourselves if we do know what happiness is, and more importantly how to pursue it.</p><p>If we are true to ourselves, most of us would agree that perhaps we really do not know what happiness is for very often we pursue what we think it is, only to discover with dismay that what we have pursued and obtained gives but short lived satisfaction. And so, we stumble desperately along a variety of paths in a renewed pursuit, each one ending in one kind of disillusionment after another.</p><h2><strong>Always alluring but never lasting</strong></h2><p>Sometimes, we think we can find happiness by pursuing riches. And we initiate long arduous journeys of investments, or disciplined yet enervating, soul-sucking, mind numbing work. And we get richer only to find that not only are we less happier than before but we really have added to our earlier problems by having now to protect and grow wealth even further. What we thought would bring us happiness has brought us only the envious glances of others less fortunate and the constant worry of how long our state of wealth will last.</p><p>Or often we pursue the happiness that comes through a flurry of partying and social engagements. And we soon discover that while the company of others provides great solace from the sordid realities of life, the more such solace is pursued, the less satisfaction it brings. Our own social circles no matter how polished or sophisticated soon reveal themselves to be faulty men and women just like us. Eventually, human nature reveals itself in petty jealousies, cliches, arrogance, quarrels and the million other conditions of being human.</p><p>And so we discover that whatever the path of pursuit we choose, whether it be intoxication, sensuality, fame, or entertainment, the more we pursue that path the less pleasure it brings. Happiness seems within our grasp, but it keeps us constantly thirsting for more. And the more we drink of its cup, the more empty we eventually feel. Sometimes, in our mad rush to keep ourselves happy, we end up damaging our health, sometimes our consciences, good names, and instead of happiness we find ourselves living with sadness, guilt, depression, fear, or a myriad other ills.</p><h2><strong>Can there be a universal prescription?</strong></h2><p>In spite of mankind's various quests over time, lasting happiness remains something mysteriously unattainable. Perhaps, only the creator God who made mankind has the answer to what brings about a happiness which is not short lived, and which has no bitterness accompanying it.</p><p>We only have to look to the scriptures for God's prescription for happiness. In the bible, in Chapter 5 of The Gospel according to Mathew, we read the Beatitudes which forms part of the Lord’s Sermon on the Mount. Beatitudes is a term meaning exceedingly great happiness. Our Lord, after he had chosen his disciples, separated them from the crowds, a metaphor for how they were to be separated from the people of the world and their human-oriented thinking, and rather taught them eight divine prescriptions that would bring lasting, no, eternal happiness. These teachings still stand true for every believer in Christ who is called to separate from the world systems of happiness and to seek and find happy satisfaction through a higher path.</p><p><strong>Mat 5:1-10<br></strong>And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:<br>And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,</p><ul><li><p><em>Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</em></p></li></ul><p>Observing His teachings closely we realize how diametrically different His prescriptions for happiness are when compared to our ingrained habits of pursuit.</p><ul><li><p>The world says "Pursue riches;" He says "Be poor in spirit."</p></li><li><p>The world says "Pursue laughter; party hard;" He says "Mourn for your sins."</p></li><li><p>The world says "Be cool by behaving arrogantly;" He says "Be meek."</p></li><li><p>The world says "Live loose, fast, and free;" He says "Hunger and thirst after righteousness."</p></li><li><p>The world says "It's all right to keep all matter of impure thoughts in your hearts;" He says "Be pure in your hearts."</p></li><li><p>The world says "Get back at those who hurt you;" He says "Forgive and be merciful."</p></li><li><p>The world says "Make war against your enemies;" He says "Pursue peace."</p></li><li><p>The world says "Fit in with the crowd to avoid persecution;" He says "Stand up for right behaviour and be happy when you are persecuted."</p></li></ul><p>What kind of way of life is this? Can anyone living in the world even believe that living according to these teachings would bring any kind of happiness let alone lasting happiness? These make sense only in the light of the great eternal promises tied to them as rewards, and in the light of the God who stands as the guarantor of their eternal truths. Consider the greatness of the promises: inheriting the Kingdom of Heaven, inheriting the earth, seeing God, being called the children of God, obtaining mercy, obtaining comfort, being filled.</p><h2><strong>Happiness in the Spirit</strong></h2><p>The obeying of the Beatitudes is likely to bring scorn and sorrow from the world system and its adherents. But the divine guarantor stands by and fulfils His promises through the work of His invisible Holy Spirit. What one who begins even to incredulously obey soon discovers is a strange divine consolation, a divine joy, something approaching inexpressible happiness welling up within. And so as one continues to strive according to these prescriptions, these promised blessings becomes strangely real though still unexplainable to anyone watching. It appears folly and yet it is not. It is but a foretaste of the rewards of faith that keeps one going on ahead in the pursuit in spite of the difficulties that stand in the way. And as one continues trying through repeated failures, the Teacher pours out a divine, equally inexpressible strength to live out this impossible calling.</p><h2><strong>The Beatitudes and the Sermon on the Mount</strong></h2><p>One way or the other, the beatitudes in the Lord’s Sermon on the Mount are mind-blowing. Many who read them walk away scoffing at their seeming foolishness, but those who have begun to appreciate the wisdom and divinity of the Teacher begin to live out these teachings and enjoy a growing rather than diminishing state of inexpressible happiness.</p><p>However, all who seek to implement the teachings of the mount must also keep in mind the other mount, the mount of Calvary. Writer and Roman Catholic Archbishop, Fulton J Sheen, in his book The Life of Christ, says "<i>The day Our Lord taught the Beatitudes, He signed His own death warrant. The sound of nails and hammers digging through human flesh were the echoes thrown back from the mountainside where He told men how to be happy or blessed.</i>"</p><p>The teaching of one mount comes paired with the suffering of the other. Anyone who seeks to be a disciple of the Lord will experience that even as his master was persecuted, so will he be persecuted. His rejection will overflow into our lives; the insults that missed His ears will fall on our ears; there will be scorn and ridicule; and were one to follow this so completely that the Heavenly Father considers him or her worthy, there may even be martyrdom.</p><p>So discovered the early disciples, who had the crown of martyrdom pressed onto their heads, and we consider them exceedingly blessed. May God bless us all too in his coming Kingdom even as we seek to understand and apply the Beatitudes in our own reconfigured pursuit of happiness.</p><p class="align-right"><em>Last Updated: 27 April 2020</em></p><hr><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Observations on Life in General, © 2020, Charlie Joseph<script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[
