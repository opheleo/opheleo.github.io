The bill established June 19 as a legal public holiday to commemorate the emancipation of last African American slaves in the United States in 1865. So what really happened on June 19, 1865?<br><br>Between 1861-65, the Northern and the Southern states of the US were fighting a bitter civil war over the greatly divisive issue of the slaves. In 1862, then US President Abraham Lincoln officially outlawed slavery, but as the war raged on not all slaves realized their freedoms at the same time - Texas was the last state to officially declare all slaves free. Most slaves in this remote part of the Union were still unaware of their freedom until June 19, 1865 when the Union army rode into Galveston and General Gordon Granger announced General Order No. 3 proclaiming and enforcing the freedom of enslaved people in Texas, the last state of the Confederacy with institutional slavery.<br><br>Today while people across the US celebrate Juneteenth as emancipation day, the sad truth is that even today there are slaves of a different kind who do not realize that they have been set free. Here's the back story for a different kind of emancipation, an extract from the gospel of Luke in the Bible. The passage speaks about Jesus Christ making an important proclamation.</p><p><em>And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as was his custom, he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and he stood up to read. And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,</em><br></p><p class="align-center"><i>“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br>because he has anointed me<br>to proclaim good news to the poor.<br>He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives<br>and recovering of sight to the blind,<br>to set at liberty those who are oppressed,<br>to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.”</i></p><p><i>And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. And he began to say to them, <code>“Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”</code></i><br><br>So what really did this proclamation mean and who was being set free?<br><br>Ever since Adam sinned against the God of the universe, mankind has been enslaved to sin. Knowingly or unknowingly every human on the planet since that day has been a slave to the Devil and to Sin. Like the descendants of the African slaves snatched away from their lives of freedom in their own lands to brutal labor in a distant country, we too have forgotten what life in the beautiful garden of Eden once was where we enjoyed to an unimaginable degree fellowship and friendship with the God of love. Today we spend our lives in conditions of horrendous slavery, sometimes even forgetting that life could be any other way.<br><br>But God in His love for man had made a proclamation against the Devil long ago, written for us in the Book of Genesis:</p><p class="align-center"><i>"I will put enmity between you and the woman,<br>and between your offspring and her offspring;<br>he shall bruise your head,<br>and you shall bruise his heel.”</i></p><p>Jesus had ridden into town carrying the proclamation of freedom in Himself. He was the One who would set the captives free and He did exactly that by dying on the cross. A tremendous price needed to be paid to set the slaves free from the clutches of the Devil and His death was the price. His resurrection was the proof that freedom was secured. And like Juneteenth, across the world, people celebrate Easter Sunday as the day when freedom was secured for one and all.<br><br>Today, the message of the gospel, or good news, has been proclaimed across the world. Many have been set free, many are being set free, but the battle rages on to set the last slave free to experience the glorious liberty of the children of God.<br></p><h2 id="references">References:</h2><ul><li><span style="color: var(--eb-text-primary-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: 1em; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/475" target="_blank">https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/475</a>&nbsp;</span><br></li><li>The Gospel according to Luke, Chapter 4:16-22, The Holy Bible</li><li>The Book of Genesis, Chapter 3: verse 15, The Holy Bible</li></ul></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 20, 2021</p><div class="post__tags-share"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/writings/">Articles</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/gospel/">Gospel</a></li></ul><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Fjuneteenth-galveston-and-jerusalem%2F" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://worm.gq/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Fjuneteenth-galveston-and-jerusalem%2F&amp;via=Worm&amp;text=Juneteenth%2C%20Galveston%2C%20and%20Jerusalem%C2%A0" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://worm.gq/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Fjuneteenth-galveston-and-jerusalem%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F27%2FSlavery.jpg&amp;description=Juneteenth%2C%20Galveston%2C%20and%20Jerusalem%C2%A0" class="js-share pinterest" aria-label="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://worm.gq/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Fjuneteenth-galveston-and-jerusalem%2F&amp;title=Juneteenth%2C%20Galveston%2C%20and%20Jerusalem%C2%A0" class="js-share linkedin" aria-label="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://worm.gq/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Juneteenth%2C%20Galveston%2C%20and%20Jerusalem%C2%A0 https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Fjuneteenth-galveston-and-jerusalem%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://worm.gq/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></aside></div><div class="post__bio author"><img src="https://worm.gq/media/website/worm.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="cj" class="author__avatar"><div><h3 class="h6 author__name"><a href="https://worm.gq/authors/iraxel/" class="invert" title="cj">cj</a></h3><p class="author__desc">cj is a worm who occasionally strings together words to help fellow worms and those who haven&#x27;t yet realised that they are worms, to know more about The Word.
