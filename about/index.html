The site contains a collection of short posts, or longer essays - primarily mediations and thoughts on various portions of God’s holy Word - the Bible. The author hopes that these will in someway or other be a blessing to all who read, especially Christians. Who is the author of these posts? He goes by the pen name Baruch Who is Baruch? The biblical Baruch was a faithful attendant of the Israelite prophet Jeremiah (626 - 587 BC), and was primarily known for writing down his master’s prophecies and reading them to people. The Baruch who maintains this site is not as faithful as his biblical namesake, but seeks to serve his own master, the Lord Jesus Christ through his writing. Why does Baruch write here? Baruch is simply a Christian believer who desires to grow in his faith as he reads God’s Word and also desires to share what he gleans from his readings so as to bless and encourage fellow believers across the world who chance to stumble across this site. The apostle John wrote ”These things we write, so that our joy may be made complete.” Baruch also desires an experience of similar joy through the exercise of writing, as he shares what he learns along the pathway of Christian experience, . Who is a believer? What does a believer believe in? A believer is one who believes that Jesus Christ is the son of God, who took on human form and appeared on the face of planet earth sometime in the middle of its tortured history to become a sinless sacrifice that atones for the sins of mankind. A believer believes that Jesus Christ was crucified, and through that death by crucifixion paid the price of redemption that quenched God’s holy wrath towards sinners. A believer believes that Jesus Christ not only died but also rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of God as King of Kings and Lord of Lords. A believer also believes that unlike His first appearance, the Lord Jesus Christ will come again, this time in all His glory and power to execute judgment on this perishing and sinful world, and only those who have put their faith in the redeeming power of His sacrifice will escape the eternal punishment of God’s wrath. What is sin and why God so angry? Do believers really believe all this stuff? Where does all this come from? Yes they do. The believe because the Bible says so and because God has put faith into their hearts to believe what the Bible says. But explaining the entire nature of a believer’s belief is beyond the scope of this FAQ. Do reach out to Baruch who will attempt to clarify any queries or doubts you wish to get answered. Do also go through the posts on this site which may be helpful. Better still try and get your hands on a copy of the Bible which contains truth that is eternal. A good place to start reading the Bible would be the section called gospel of John. One verse that is really helpful in understanding the crux of Baruch’s belief is found in John chapter 6 and verse 16: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.” You can reach out to Baruch through the comments sections beneath each post, or by using the contact form here.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Articles and Essays for Spiritual Gain, © 2020, Opheleo<script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[
