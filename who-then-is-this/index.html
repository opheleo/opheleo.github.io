They were terrified though they had Jesus in the boat with them because they did not realize who He really was. And so God used the storm as a means to reveal His Son to them.</p><p>Often, the storms we find ourselves stuck in, terrify us. And we ask ourselves why God allows them to hit us. The world is struck daily by natural calamities, accidents, wars, social turmoil and people ask why a good God, if He exists, would allow such things to occur. The answer is because He wants to reveal His Son to us.</p><p>The alternative is terrifying too. And in a far worse way. For unless we truly come to know the Son and the power He alone has to save us, we are lost for eternity.</p><p>Whatever may be your storm today, turn to Him. You may not, like the disciples, know who He truly is. But turn to Him and give Him an opportunity to take you through the storm, and you will gain an increased understanding or at least the wonder to ask "Who then is this?"</p><p>We may wish for the storms around us to disappear. We may wish for them never to appear. But perhaps we ought to view them as blessings. For they force us to come to the end of ourselves and turn to Him, who alone has the power to save.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Articles and Essays for Spiritual Gain, © 2020, Opheleo<script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[
