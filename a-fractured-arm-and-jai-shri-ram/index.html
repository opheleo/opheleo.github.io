The ruffians beat them up with sticks, made them squat in a humiliating corporal stress position also known as the rooster position, and forced them to insult Christ and chant a slogan "Jai Shri Ram" that is commonly used to praise the Hindu god Ram.<br><br>Threatened with being killed, and then handed over to the police, the Christians suffered grievous injuries with one of the women's arms fractured.<br><br>What led to such an assault on a peaceful gathering? The attackers claimed that the leaders of the prayer group were trying to convert the group to Christianity by offering jobs and education. This is a punishable offence under the U.P. Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance recently promulgated in Uttar Pradesh.<br><br>While the allegations may or may not be true, the question to ask is what gives groups such as the Bajrang Dal the authority to take the law into their hands and thrash people? The country routinely sees police officers standing helplessly or nonchalantly by as people take the law into their own hands. Shouldn't these Christians, citizens of the country, be given the benefit of presenting their case before a court, or are we just a banana republic where anyone with a wooden rod and a propensity to violence decides to satisfy their blood lust by passing instant judgement on people too weak to defend themselves?<br><br>What prevented the police from booking the very people who handed over these Christians for being violent and assaulting fellow citizens? In fact, a news report stated that the police themselves let blows loose on the hapless victims. If India continues down this bloody path decades after Independence and so-called development, what glory will its minority citizens see in the nation? For the past few years, these violent attacks on people of religious persuasions other than Hinduism are increasingly on the rise. The Muslims of India were the early targets, and now it is the turn of Christians being forced to go through the very same humiliation of being forced under threat of blows to recant their religious views.<br><br>Though India has a secular constitution that allows its citizens the freedom to propagate their religion, of course without allurement, the reality in the country is such today that the followers of the Christ must increasingly prepare their minds in these last days to expect heightened persecution.<br><br>For Christians across the world, across the centuries, persecution has doggedly pursued them. The Lord Jesus commanded His followers to make disciples for Him, but also clearly forewarned that persecution would be the lot of those who chose to obey His commands. Thus, what else can Indian Christians expect in these last days, when even in the US, for so long upheld as a bastion of religious freedom, persecution (though of a different sort, and from the left wing) is on the rise?<br><br>A press article on the incident:<br><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/five-including-two-from-tn-booked-for-sunday-prayer-event-in-up/article33504335.ece">https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/five-including-two-from-tn-booked-for-sunday-prayer-event-in-up/article33504335.ece</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 13, 2021</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><strong>Tagged in:</strong></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/opinion/">Opinion</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://worm.gq/authors/iraxel/" class="invert" rel="author">Charlie Joseph</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul><li><a href="https://worm.gq/home/" target="_self">Home</a></li><li class="has-submenu"><a href="https://worm.gq/writings/" target="_self" aria-haspopup="true" class="opener">Writings</a><ul class="submenu level-2" aria-hidden="true"><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/opinion/" target="_self">Opinion</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/gospel/" target="_self">Gospel</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/gleanings/" target="_self">Biblical</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/short-story/" target="_self">Short Story</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/poetry/" target="_self">Poetry</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/about/" target="_self">About</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/subscribe-2/" target="_self">Subscribe</a></li><li><a href="https://worm.gq/contact/" target="_self">Contact</a></li></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>Sed varius enim lorem ullamcorper dolore aliquam aenean ornare velit lacus,ac varius enim lorem ullamcorper dolore.
