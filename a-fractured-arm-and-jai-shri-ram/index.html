The violent group claimed that the leaders of the group were trying to convert the group to Christianity by offering jobs and education. This is a punishable offence under the U.P. Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance recently promulgated in Uttar Pradesh.<br><br>While the allegations may be true, the question to ask is what makes any group such as the Bajrang Dal the authority to take the law into their hands and thrash people? The country routinely sees even police officers standing helplessly or nonchalantly by as people take the law into their own hands. Shouldn't these Christians, citizens of the country, be given the benefit of presenting their case before a court, or are we just a banana republic where anyone with a wooden rod and a propensity to violence decides to satisfy their blood lust by passing instant judgement on people too weak to defend themselves?<br><br>What prevented the police from booking the very people who handed over these Christians for being violent and assaulting fellow citizens? If India continues down this bloody path decades after Independence and so-called development, what glory will its minority citizens see in the nation? These kinds of violent attacks on people of religious persuasions other than the Hindu majority view are increasingly on the rise. The Muslims were the early targets, but now even Christians are being forced to go through the humiliation of being forced under threat of blows to recant their religious views.<br><br>The Lord promised His followers persecution, yet also commanded them to proselytize. Though India has a secular constitution that allows its citizens the freedom to propagate their religion without allurement, the reality in the country is such today that the followers of the Lord must increasingly prepare their minds in these last days to expect such persecution. What else can Indian Christians expect in these last days, when even in the US, for so long upheld as a bastion of religious freedom, persecution (though of a different sort) is on the rise?<br><br>A press article on the incident:<br><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/five-including-two-from-tn-booked-for-sunday-prayer-event-in-up/article33504335.ece">https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/five-including-two-from-tn-booked-for-sunday-prayer-event-in-up/article33504335.ece</a></p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 13, 2021</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://charliejoseph.ml/tag/opinion/">Opinion</a></li></ul></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://charliejoseph.ml/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://charliejoseph.ml/bitter-grapes/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Bitter Grapes</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Observations on Life in General, © 2020, Charlie Joseph</p><p><script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[
