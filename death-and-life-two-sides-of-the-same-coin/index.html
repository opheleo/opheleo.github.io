What can be seen however are the frightening graphs of infections and deaths, and the sobering projections of swathes of many more people, countless more, who could die, and die tragically. At a time like this, amidst the fear and gloom for loved ones and self alike, for the economic future, and for the many other uncertainties that lie ahead, one's thoughts turn to a subject that is normally not top of mind.</p><h2><strong>The specter of mortality</strong></h2><p>Rising from beneath the covers to which it is normally subjected to, the idea of mortality wakes up and walks across one's consciousness. No longer is it shushed and shooed away by the busyness of a usually busy life. It stands around like an uninvited guest not knowing what to do with itself. Yet it cannot leave. The doors are closed.</p><p>Mortality. An idea whose time is now. Many who had planned their careers, travel plans, education, or comfortable retirement have felt the icy fingers of death reminding them of that word. Many are no longer around to consider its implications for life on the planet, but many have recovered and cannot forget their close encounter. And like them, for the vast majority of humanity that hasn't had a close call yet, this is a clarion call to remind themselves of that word. Because, even though the pandemic may pass away sooner or later, that word remains standing around with its timeless truth - everyone dies. One way or another.</p><p>So how is one to make sense of one's mortality? Is one to morbidly mope around waiting for the inevitable? Or must one climb the mountains and meditate for an escape route because really who wants to die? Is there an escape route? If yes, where can it be found?</p><h2><strong>Comfortless answers</strong></h2><p>What is being taught in schools and colleges across the world is the so-called science of evolution. We are being told that we evolved from lower life forms and that as a race we continue to evolve. The answers of that logic, to the questions posed by this pandemic, is that individuals do not matter. Hundreds of thousands may die but the race will live on. A vaccine will be found. Herd immunity will develop. This will be wiped out. Those left behind can let out a sigh of relief. For now.</p><p>But somehow, those words ring hollow of comfort. If evolution is all there is, what then of individual purpose and meaning? Is this all we scrounge around on the surface of the earth for, as contributors to the progress of the race? Why not live like beasts then for tomorrow we die - surely there must be more!</p><h2><strong>God. Eternity.</strong></h2><p>So, then we turn to faith and God and eternity. Most do in times of turmoil. Because we eventually discover a buried concept within us that is but the other side of mortality. If mortality means death, then immortality must mean life forever. But can both coexist when all we see is the certainty of death heading towards us like an onrushing wave? Surely, they can. That is if we have eternal spirits, and mortality is merely a transition to a higher state of consciousness. A consciousness that encompasses beings and powers that we are not normally aware of. And so, like many others who have pursued this train of thought, our thoughts turn to gods and our conceptions of them. For if they exist how can we know them? Do we need to know them? If the spiritual plane of consciousness is a reality, why are we so afraid? Is a spiritual reality worse than the world we have known or is it an endless experience of endless delights?</p><h2><strong>Seeking life not death</strong></h2><p>The answers to these questions will determine our state of mind as we go through this pandemic. Many have sought these answers but none can claim to have definitively found them. But many have found the solace of faith. Faith comes in different hues, different shapes. But faith comforts as long as it can explain. A child believes it can fly until it falls with a crash when it leaps off a bed. And so, like children, we keep growing in our awareness, shedding our childish beliefs as they fail to prove or explain the realities of our life experiences. We discover laws like gravity, and when we understand the inevitability of those laws, we use them and learn how to really fly. Not in painful ignorance and the inevitable crash, but through understanding and cooperating with those laws we even reach other planets.</p><p>And so, even as we go through that process, we realize that this is what life is. A discovery of the physical, and then as we grow older and wiser, the metaphysical truths. We examine the various concepts that spirituality has to offer. Some say this, some say that, but even as a snake sheds its skin, we shed our incorrect conceptions and move into realities and truths that endure. And once having discovered truths that sustain, we continue on to deeper truths. Thus, many claim their faith protects them from plagues and sicknesses, but then from the hospital bed they realize the higher ideas that faith can in the end only save them from diseases of the soul. And so, all of life is about realizing that mortality cannot be cheated. Death is the price to be paid for life. And may God speed us all as we go about discovering these eternal truths. </p><p class="align-right"><em>Published: April 24, 2020</em></p><hr><p> </p></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 17, 2021</p><div class="post__tags-share"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://worm.gq/tag/gleanings/">Gleanings</a></li></ul><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Fdeath-and-life-two-sides-of-the-same-coin%2F" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://worm.gq/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Fdeath-and-life-two-sides-of-the-same-coin%2F&amp;via=Worm&amp;text=Death%20and%20Life%2C%20Two%20Sides%20of%20the%20Same%20Coin" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://worm.gq/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Fdeath-and-life-two-sides-of-the-same-coin%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F7%2Fman-in-black-jacket-standing-in-front-of-grave-3648309.jpg&amp;description=Death%20and%20Life%2C%20Two%20Sides%20of%20the%20Same%20Coin" class="js-share pinterest" aria-label="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://worm.gq/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Fdeath-and-life-two-sides-of-the-same-coin%2F&amp;title=Death%20and%20Life%2C%20Two%20Sides%20of%20the%20Same%20Coin" class="js-share linkedin" aria-label="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://worm.gq/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Death%20and%20Life%2C%20Two%20Sides%20of%20the%20Same%20Coin https%3A%2F%2Fworm.gq%2Fdeath-and-life-two-sides-of-the-same-coin%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://worm.gq/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></aside></div><div class="post__bio author"><img src="https://worm.gq/media/website/worm.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="cj" class="author__avatar"><div><h3 class="h6 author__name"><a href="https://worm.gq/authors/iraxel/" class="invert" title="cj">cj</a></h3><p class="author__desc">cj is a worm who occasionally strings together words to help fellow worms and those who haven&#x27;t yet realised that they are worms, to know more about The Word.
