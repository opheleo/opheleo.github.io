Yet, because no mention - even of a minor, relatively unknown person - is there in the Holy Writ merely by chance or a passing thought, here are a few mediations on this intriguing character.</p><h2><strong>Two mentions: that's all there is</strong></h2><p>Archippus finds his first chronological mention, in Paul's letter to the Colossians. At the end of this epistle (chapter 4:17), Paul includes a personal message for Archippus: Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it. </p><p>And then in Paul's later letter to Philemon (chapter 1:2), the aged apostle now writing from Prison notes Archippus specifically as one of the recipients of this letter, even addressing him as a fellow soldier. Now that is a high honor indeed. For Paul — writing to so many in the churches he founded — addressed only a very few folks by name, let alone with such high honor.</p><h2><strong>So, what's the story?</strong></h2><p>Perhaps at the time Paul remembered him in his first letter, Archippus was not really paying much heed to his ministry, whatever that ministry may have been. And likely by the time of the latter letter, Archippus had taken Paul's earlier admonition to heart. Therefore, with no additional advice or rebuke, in the letter to Philemon Paul just greets Archippus and calls him a fellow soldier. What a rising graph Archippus' ministry must have been to have gained approbation from the renowned itinerant soldier of the gospel himself! So, the first lesson here is the need to listen and take to heart a mentoring reminder, rebuke, or correction from an older, mature saint. And this is something Archippus obviously did.</p><p>The second aspect of Archippus' life is that he needed to be reminded to keep a focus on his ministry. Paul was aware of Archippus being in the faith and part of the church at Colosse, and also somehow aware that the Lord had gifted him with a particular ministry, but that he wasn't discharging it to full effect. Perhaps Archippus started out strong, but later like many of us he must have slackened as time went by. And so the experienced apostle always on fire for the kingdom of God encouraged Archippus to pursue the completeness of service.  </p><h2><strong>So, where does that leave us?</strong></h2><p>As our walk in the faith drags on over the mountains and into the valleys, when the presence of the Lord seems dim, where do we stand on service? Are we even aware of what our ministry is - or is that something only for the teachers and the preachers? The greek word Paul used to remind Archippus of his ministry is diakonia. In 1 Corinthians 12:5, he uses the same word when he says there are "varieties of ministries."</p><p>Several ministries apart from teaching are mentioned in the scriptures such as serving food, relief to the suffering, gospel work, and serving the saints in many ways. Like Archippus, Paul reminded another one of his sons in faith, Timothy too, using literally the same words "to fulfill your ministry". And this word is for each of us as well. We need to discover our unique spiritual enablements and deploy them in service to the King, the kingdom, and the lost.</p><h2><strong>Towards fulfillment</strong></h2><p>As the days draw towards an inevitable close, there is the need to exhort our fellow soldiers. Paul even away from Colosse and in the middle of his whirlwind life yet had the spiritually lackadaisical Archippus on his mind. He sought his growth into a soldier and took the time to write to him. Even so, even though busyness proliferates on every quadrant, we need to exhort those we know who are yet slack in ministry, perhaps even ourselves.</p><p class="align-right"><strong>Last edited:</strong> 2nd June 2020<br><strong>Note:</strong> Thanks to MT for the helpful corrections.</p><p class="align-right"> </p><hr><p> </p><div id="mc_embed_signup"><form id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" class="validate" action="https://opheleo.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2b3feaac61d83cee795fbee52&amp;id=a96cc76c80" method="post" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" novalidate="" target="_blank"><div id="mc_embed_signup_scroll"><label for="mce-EMAIL">Subscribe to the latest posts straight to your inbox</label> <input id="mce-EMAIL" class="email" name="EMAIL" required="" type="email" placeholder="email address"><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px;"><input tabindex="-1" name="b_2b3feaac61d83cee795fbee52_a96cc76c80" type="text"></div><div class="clear"><input id="mc-embedded-subscribe" class="button" name="subscribe" type="submit" value="Subscribe"></div></div></form></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Articles and Essays for Spiritual Gain, © 2020, Opheleo<script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[
